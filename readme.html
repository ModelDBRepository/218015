Paper Abstract:
Developing networks of neural systems can exhibit spontaneous,
synchronous activities called neural bursts, which can be important in
the organization of functional neural circuits. Before the network
matures, the activity level of a burst can reverberate in repeated
rise-and-falls in periods of hundreds of milliseconds following an
initial wave-like propagation of spiking activity, while the burst
itself lasts for seconds. To investigate the spatiotemporal structure
of the reverberatory bursts, we culture dissociated, rat cortical
neurons on a high-density multi-electrode array to record the dynamics
of neural activity over the growth and maturation of the network. We
find the synchrony of the spiking significantly reduced following the
initial wave and the activities become broadly distributed
spatially. The synchrony recovers as the system reverberates until the
end of the burst. Using a propagation model we infer the spreading
speed of the spiking activity, which increases as the culture ages. We
perform computer simulations of the system using a physiological model
of spiking networks in two spatial dimensions and find the parameters
that reproduce the observed resynchronization of spiking in the
bursts. An analysis of the simulated dynamics suggests that the
depletion of synaptic resources causes the resynchronization. The
spatial propagation dynamics of the simulations match well with
observations over the course of a burst and point to an interplay of
the synaptic efficacy and the noisy neural self-activation in
producing the morphology of the bursts.
